				<li>Pentathlon consists of 5 puzzles that must be completed for each level.</li>
				<li>The Maze is the primary driver of game play.</li>
				<li>When you come into the maze, you cannot see any of the walls.	</li>
				<li>This panel, on the left, shows a 2D representation of the maze, and shows you where the exit is.</li>
			</ul></td></tr>
	<tr>
			<td><ul>
				<li>This panel, on the right, shows a 3D representation of the cell that you are currently in.</li>
				<li>The yellow circle shows you which door you entered through.</li>
				<li>All doors are visible on the 3D panel.</li>
				<li>You click the doors, or use the keyboard arrow keys, to navigate through the Maze.</li>
			</ul></td>

			<td><ul>
				<li>As you move through the maze, each cell you've visited will change color.</li>
				<li>Each cells "owns" its south and east walls; doors on those walls will be displayed once you've visited it.</li>
				<li>Doors on the north and west walls can only be seen in the 3D view of the cell you're in, unless the cell that "owns" them has been visited.</li>
			</ul></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td><ul>
				<li>This is the 3D view of the cell above. The letter U has been found, from the Anchors Away game.</li>
				<li>As you find the pieces in the maze, they will light up in the puzzle they're from. You don't need to click on them.</li>
				<li>In this view, you can see a door on the west wall.</li>
				<li>If you compare the 2D view, that door is not displayed because it is "owned" by a cell that hasn't been visited yet.</li>

				<li>In this 2D view, you can't see that there's a wall to the north, because you haven't been there yet.</li>
				<li>It looks like there's no wall to the south, and there isn't -- that one you can be sure of.</li>
				<li>But if you look at the 3D view of the cell (below), you can clearly see that there's no door to the north, but there is one to the south.</li>

			<td><ul>
				<li>Also, you'll notice two other buttons on this panel next to the HELP button.</li>
				<li>The GAME HISTORY button will show you past games. The best games are sorted to the top.</li>
				<li>The NEW GAME button will start a new game. When you come into Pentathlon, you will automatically be at the beginning of the level you were at when you left.</li>
				<li>If you reach a level that's more taxing than you care to deal with, start a new game! </li>

				<li>You don't have to solve it right away, but if you do, and there are game pieces you haven't found yet, you will be shown where some of them are.</li>
				<li>Each time you solve a puzzle, you'll be shown the whereabouts of unfound pieces to the next puzzle.</li>
				<li>When you've solved all the puzzles, you'll be told to head for the Maze Exit.</li>
			</ul></td>

	<tr>
			<td><ul>
				<li>Once all the puzzles have been solved, a door will appear to the next level.</li>
				<li>Click on the door, or use the arrow keys, to move to the next level.</li>
				<li>There are a possible 27 levels, but usually less, depending on Same Difference.</li>
				<li>The game is saved at the beginning of each level, so if you close the application, when you restart it, you will be at the beginning of the level.</li>
